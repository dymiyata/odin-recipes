    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mapo tofu is a classic Chinese dish from the Sichuan province, known for
      its bold flavors and characteristic numbing spiciness. It features tender
      cubes of silken or medium-firm tofu simmered in a rich, spicy sauce made
      from doubanjiang (fermented broad bean paste) and seasoned with Sichuan
      peppercorns, which provide a unique, tingling sensation. The dish also
      includes ground pork or beef, which adds depth and umami, along with
      garlic, ginger, green onions, and sometimes fermented black beans for an
      extra layer of complexity. The result is a vibrant red and spicy sauce
      that perfectly balances heat, saltiness, and savory flavors. Mapo tofu is
      traditionally served hot, usually with steamed rice, allowing the intense
      flavors to shine.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>oil</li>
      <li>1-2 Thai bird chili peppers (sliced)</li>
      <li>6-8 dried red chilies (roughly chopped)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of Sichuan peppercorns (ground)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons ginger (minced)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons garlic (minced)</li>
      <li>8 ounces ground pork</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons of Pixian doubanjiang</li>
      <li>2/3 cup chicken broth (or water)</li>
      <li>1 pound silken tofu</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 scallion (sliced)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First, we toast the chilies. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low
          heat. Add half of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir
          occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the
          peppers don’t burn. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the
          ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then
          turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and
          fry it until it’s cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns
          and stir for about 15-30 seconds, taking care to not let it burn, as it
          will turn bitter if it does.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the doubanjiang to the mixture and stir it in well. Add the
          chicken broth to the wok and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so.
          While that's happening, ready your tofu and combine the water and
          cornstarch in a small bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away
          until the sauce starts to thicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then add your chili oil from before—peppers and all! Stir the oil into
          the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in
          the sauce. Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and
          sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir until the scallions
          are just wilted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn powder.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
