    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern dish made of ground chickpeas or fava
      beans, or a combination of both, formed into small, round patties or balls
      and deep-fried to a crispy, golden perfection. The mixture is typically
      flavored with fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro, or dill, and spices such
      as cumin, coriander, and garlic, giving the falafel a distinctive earthy,
      slightly spicy taste. Known for its crunchy exterior and soft, flavorful
      interior, falafel is often served in pita bread or flatbread, accompanied
      by fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. Common toppings
      include tahini sauce, yogurt sauce, or a dash of spicy harissa, adding a
      creamy or tangy contrast to the dish.

      Falafel’s origins are ancient and believed to trace back to Egypt, where
      it was traditionally made with fava beans. It has since spread across the
      Middle East and beyond, becoming especially popular in Israel, Lebanon,
      and Syria, where chickpeas are more commonly used. Today, falafel is
      enjoyed worldwide as a versatile, plant-based protein option and a staple
      of street food, often paired with hummus, pickles, and salad for a
      complete and satisfying meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound dried chickpeas (1 generous cup)</li>
      <li>2 ounces cilantro, parsley, mint (about 2 cups total)</li>
      <li>6 scallions (white and pale green part)</li>
      <li>2 medium cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water,
          adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume.
          Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day,
          drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and
          salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are
          very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the
          sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball
          should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more.
        </p>
      </li>

          Transfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15
          minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This
          will help the balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a
          tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into
          your hand. Gently shape each into a ball (you will not be able to roll
          the mixture like cookie dough; this is okay) and place them on a clean
          plate.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          When all the balls have been formed, fill a deep cast iron, carbon
          steel, or nonstick skillet or Dutch oven with 3/4 inch of oil. Heat
          over high heat until oil registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read
          thermometer. Carefully lower chickpea balls into oil one at a time,
          allowing a little space between each ball and cooking in batches if
          necessary. Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a temperature of
          between 350 and 375°F (175 and 190°C). Allow to cook undisturbed until
          well browned on bottom sides, then carefully flip balls with a fork
          until browned on second side, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cooked
          chickpea balls to a paper towel–lined plate and season with salt.
          Repeat with remaining chickpea balls.
        </p>

          Serve immediately with tahini and/or hummus on the side, or stuffed
          into pita bread with tahini, tomatoes, cucumber, pickles, and shredded
          cabbage.
        </p>
