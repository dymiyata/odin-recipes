    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Garlic noodles are a flavorful fusion dish with origins rooted in the
      culinary creativity of San Francisco’s Vietnamese immigrant community.
      They were popularized in the 1970s by a Vietnamese-American restaurant,
      Thanh Long, which brought Southeast Asian flavors into a Western dining
      context. Originally created as a complement to the restaurant’s signature
      roasted crab, garlic noodles quickly became iconic in their own right.
      Blending Vietnamese, Chinese, and Italian influences, this dish
      exemplifies the adaptation of Asian cuisine for American palates. While
      its precise origins are tied to the Vietnamese diaspora, garlic noodles
      have since become beloved across various Asian-American kitchens, evolving
      with different regional takes and variations.

    <p>
      Their distinct blend of buttery richness and umami with a punch of garlic
      encapsulates the multicultural essence of Vietnamese-American cooking.
      Today, garlic noodles are a staple in many restaurants, especially along
      the West Coast, and are celebrated as a simple yet indulgent dish that
      bridges diverse culinary traditions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>20 medium garlic gloves (smashed in mortar and pestle)</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons oyster sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons shoyu</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 ounce Parmesan</li>
      <li>sliced scallions (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Melt the butter in a wok or saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic
          and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add
          the oyster sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce, and stir to combine. Remove
          from the heat.

          Meanwhile, bring 1½ inches of water to a boil in a 12-​inch skillet or
          sauté pan over high heat. (Alternatively, heat up just enough water to
          cover the spaghetti in a large Dutch oven or saucepan.) Add the pasta,
          stir a few times to make sure it’s not clumping, and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until just shy of al dente (about 2 minutes short of the
          recommended cook time on the package).
        </p>
      </li>

          Using tongs, transfer the cooked pasta to the garlic sauce, along with whatever water clings to it. (Reserve
          the pasta water in the skillet.) Increase the heat to high, add the cheese to the wok, and stir with a wooden
          spatula or spoon and toss vigorously until the sauce is creamy and emulsified, about 30 seconds. If the sauce
          looks too watery, let it keep reducing. If it looks greasy, splash some more cooking water into it and let it
          re-​emulsify. Stir in the scallions (if using), and serve immediately.
